# PhysicsSimApp

This app runs 7 different physics experiments carried out during A-levels.

The user can input their variables, then watch an animation emulating the experiment along with a live table of results being generated below. This is then followed a graph and question.

When first running the program from the main menu, modules such as pygame will be installed if they aren't already installed.

You will require pip3 in order to run the application
